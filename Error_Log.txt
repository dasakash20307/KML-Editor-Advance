KML Editor V5 Error Log
===================

1. Resource Path Error
---------------------
Location: ui/widgets/kml_editor_view_widget.py
Error: NameError: name 'resource_path' is not defined
Status: FIXED
Fix: Added missing import 'from core.utils import resource_path'

2. Style.qss Path Error
----------------------
Location: launcher_app.py
Error: Global stylesheet 'assets/style.qss' not found at incorrect path
Status: FIXED
Fix: Modified path handling to use absolute path from project root

3. Windows Theme Mode Error
--------------------------
Location: launcher_app.py
Error: Could not set Windows theme mode: function 'SetPreferredAppMode' not found
Status: NON-CRITICAL
Note: This is a Windows-specific feature and doesn't affect core functionality

4. Resource Path Function Issues
------------------------------
Location: core/utils.py
Error: Function assumes all resources are in assets directory
Status: FIXED
Fix: Modified to handle both assets and UI file paths correctly

5. KML Editor Functionality Issues
--------------------------------
Location: ui/widgets/kml_editor_view_widget.py
Error: AttributeError: 'KMLEditorViewWidget' object has no attribute 'original_kml_content'
Status: FIXED
Fix: Completely refactored KMLEditorViewWidget with proper initialization of all required attributes and improved UI handling

6. Google Earth Path Format Issue
-------------------------------
Location: ui/widgets/google_earth_webview_widget.py
Error: Incorrect path format for Windows (forward slashes instead of backslashes)
Status: FIXED
Fix: Added proper path handling with Windows-style backslashes and temporary file management

Current Status:
--------------
1. Fixed resource_path import in KMLEditorViewWidget
2. Fixed resource_path function to handle both assets and UI paths
3. Fixed style.qss loading in launcher_app.py
4. Verified style.qss exists and is valid
5. Fixed KML editor functionality with proper state management
6. Improved Google Earth integration with correct Windows path handling

Next Steps:
----------
1. Test the KML editor functionality thoroughly
2. Verify Google Earth integration works with the new path handling
3. Monitor for any new errors that may appear
4. Consider implementing additional error handling and logging

Note: The Windows theme mode error is non-critical and doesn't affect core functionality. It's a Windows-specific feature that may not be available on all Windows versions.
